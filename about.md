CERES is a utility for deep space navigation, mapping, and geophysical parameter estimation of asteroids, comets, and other planetary bodies.  It aims to provide a framework both for scripting in a research setting and implementation into NASA's core Flight Software such that it can be used in-flight.

We are currently in the process of preparing for an initial alpha release.  More information will be made available once the initial release has been made.
